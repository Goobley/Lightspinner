# Lightspinner

_Learn radiative transfer like it's 1992!_

### C. Osborne (University of Glasgow), 2020, MIT License

Lightspinner is a relatively simple, but complete pure python optically thick radiative transfer (RT) code using the Rybicki-Hummer Multi-level Accelerated Lambda Iteration (MALI) formalism.
It is, in essence, a stripped down version of [Lightweaver](https://github.com/Goobley/Lightweaver) with the aim of teaching the methods used in optically thick RT and making them more accessible.
That is, if you learn methods by reading code, like I do.
It uses the full preconditioning method of Rybicki & Hummer (1992) with the ability to handle overlapping transitions, but under the assumption of complete redistribution.
The formal solver is currently using simple piecewise linear short characteristics due to its simplicity and the pedagogic benefits thereof. 

### Setup

Requires python 3.7+.
For those that use `conda` the `environment.yml` can be used to create a Lightspinner environment complete with all necessary packages with `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
This can then be activated with `conda activate Lightspinner`.
This environment should then be ready for action and you should be able to easily produce the spectrum of Ca II in a FALC atmosphere with `ipython -i test.py`.
